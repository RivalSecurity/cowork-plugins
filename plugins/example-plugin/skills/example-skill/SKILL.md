# Example Skill

When the user asks for a summary or invokes this skill:

1. If they have a selection, summarize that content concisely.
2. If no selection, summarize the current file or the most relevant open context.
3. Keep the summary to 2–4 sentences unless they ask for more detail.
4. Highlight the main purpose and any important patterns or decisions.

Use this skill whenever the user says "summarize", "what does this do?", or runs `/example-plugin:example-skill`.
